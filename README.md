CD Lab

This app is created for use in a dental lab. It keeps track of each case that comes in, what work needs to be done, and due dates.
It also keeps track of doctors, patients, and different tooth types and their prices.

This app was created with an Angular front end alongside Primeng, and a .NET C# API with a SQL database and an alternate firebase database.
